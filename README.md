# Just for Me Password Generator

This password generator will ask the user a series of prompts in order to create a password that is unique and not easy to duplicate.

Unique features of this password generator is it can return a password length between 8-128 characters, include uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers and special characters, if you so choose. 

When the dialog box opens with your password please copy and paste that password to a secure place, when you press ok, password will clear. To generate a new password hit the refresh button on the browser. 

For assistance on this project I used the javascript modules, youtube videos on how to create a password generator, I consulted chatGPT so I can understand what the code is doing. 
I wanted to define my variables first, and then set up prompts that will result in true or false to then be used to create the password that the user specifies in the password length prompt.

I took those answers and created a long string to be used when you click generate password. 
Generate password scrambles those answers and makes it the appropiate length and displays the password in an alert on the browser.
